        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.

            If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

            You can use React without a framework, however weâ€™ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.
